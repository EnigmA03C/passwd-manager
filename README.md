# What this is

this project aims at creating a very simple password storage using yaml files.
the way this will work is by having the code do read and write operations using commands
in the style of:

passwd create SERVICE MAIL|USERNAME PASSWORD
passwd get SERVICE
passwd delete SERVICE

# What this is not

this program is not meant to be secure nor is it meant to be particularly complex.
I am not an exceptionally good programmer so dont expect much, although i do aim to learn,
so if you have valid criticism or contributions i am happy to accept.
