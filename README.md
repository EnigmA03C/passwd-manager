# What this is

this project aims at creating a very simple password storage using yaml files.
the way this will work is by having the code do read and write operations using commands
in the style of:

passwd-m create SERVICE MAIL|USERNAME PASSWORD
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
>>>>>>> f56ed10bdd340291cc188a19eeb239b44a79035e
passwd-m get SERVICE

# What this is not

this program is not meant to be secure nor is it meant to be particularly complex.
I am not an exceptionally good programmer so dont expect much, although i do aim to learn,
so if you have valid criticism or contributions i am happy to accept.
